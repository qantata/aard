## web-design-demo

This is a static demo for the web interface of Aard. It's used to design new versions of the web interface.

The version of this package means that it's the target version for the `web` package to implement its design.

This package doesn't implement any functionality for the web interface; it's purely visual and all data visible on the new design elements are hardcoded.
